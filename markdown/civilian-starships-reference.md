## HHI Light Courier (LC-4) "Needler"

### Overview
A compact, high-speed civilian courier built for rapid point-to-point message and package delivery. The LC-4 prioritizes hyperdrive performance and acceleration over comfort, cargo space, or endurance. Often piloted solo, the “Needler” is a favorite among express courier outfits, newsburst carriers, small corporate branches, and independent dispatch pilots who value speed above all else.

---

### Specifications

**Class:** Light Courier (LC-4)  
**Manufacturer:** Huma Heavy Industrial  
**Hull Type:** Micro-courier starcraft  
**Price:** **Cr240,000 ± Cr30,000** (low to mid civilian range)  
**Hyperdrive Grade:** **4** (modern civilian standard)  
**Sublight Performance:** High thrust, sharp vectoring at short ranges  
**Armament:** none (structurally too light for most mounts)  
**Cargo Capacity:** **1–2 tons** (usually sealed containers)  
**Passenger Capacity:** **1** standard seat + **1 fold-down jump seat**  
**Crew:** **1** (pilot/operator)  
**Common Users:** Express courier guilds, news networks, private dispatch services, mid-scale corporations  
**Mission Profile:** Rapid delivery, data transfers, high-priority dispatch, emergency supply drops  

---

### Interior Layout (Minimalist Point-to-Point Configuration)

- **Cockpit** — single pilot seat, wraparound controls, small emergency fold-down jump seat  
- **Micro-Quarters** — half-length bunk or rest capsule behind cockpit  
- **Airlock** — compact, usually dorsal or ventral  
- **Cargo Bay** — narrow, container-sized space for sealed cargo or message pods  
- **Galley Unit** — none; replaced with a long-duration ration storage slot  
- **Hygiene** — micro-toilet only (“coffin cabinet” style); couriers joke that this is the least-loved feature  
- **Engineering** — aft hyperdrive chamber; extremely tight maintenance access  

Couriers often describe the Needler’s interior as “a chair, a closet, and an engine.”

---

### Operational Notes

- **Speed Priority:** The LC-4 is designed to arrive *first*—comfort is secondary.  
- **Crew Fatigue:** Courier captains often rotate shifts with other local pilots; long solo runs can be taxing.  
- **Maintenance:** Sensitive hyperdrive tolerances require consistent tune-ups.  
- **Structural Limits:** The hull is extremely light; cannot mount normal starship weapons without reinforcement.
