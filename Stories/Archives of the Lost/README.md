# Archives of the Lost  
*A recovered anthology of apocryphal transmissions and field fragments from the Aether Galaxy.*

---

## Curator’s Preface
Across the long silence of the Aether, faint signals still drift,  
voices of wanderers, miners, smugglers, pilots, and mystics who perished before their stories could unfold.  

The **Archives of the Lost** preserve these echoes.  
Each recovered fragment is drawn from a life ended abruptly: by storm, by blaster, by sickness, by betrayal.  
Some fell nameless in the dust. Others vanished between the stars.  

Their transmissions endure, fragments of purpose and memory,  
resonant within the Aether long after their mortal light was extinguished.  

> **No canon, only coherence.**  
> Every death is a signal. Every signal, a story.

## Overview
**Archives of the Lost** is an open anthology of in-universe data fragments: survivor logs, mission records, and final messages, recovered from across the **Aether Galaxy**.  

Each entry memorializes a character lost too soon.  
Together, they form a mosaic of endings that reveal the living texture of the galaxy: its peril, fragility, and grace.

## Reading Order
The Archives are not chronological.  
Readers are invited to explore in any order since each log stands alone and harmonizes with the others.  
Coherence arises from resonance, not sequence.
