> I am stranded in the desert with eight other miners, my crew, my brothers in the dust. We were pulling clarminite and gold out of the dunes when the storm hit.
>
> Help’s on the way, they said. But we’ve been three days out of food, two days out of water. Nowhere safe to run, no bay to shelter from the storm. Must’ve took the rigs. If we don’t dig fast enough, I'll perish out here.
>
> As I sit choking, I think back to something a human told me:
> *“Life is tough out here on the Rim. Folks coreward, in the Commonwealth, they got their high-minded ideals. But them ideals don’t do much to keep the gricks away from your vapor condensers.”*
>
> *End data entry.*

**Addendum:**

> *“Leroshed” — Ruqan slang for withered, dried, or desiccated. Often used idiomatically to describe one who succumbed to the desert or the void.*

**Archivist’s Commentary: On the Early Worlds**

> *The planet Qas Almeidi remains the earliest recorded world in recovered pre-Commonwealth Rim data. Perilous and remote, it yields the first known transmissions now preserved within the Archives of the Lost.*
