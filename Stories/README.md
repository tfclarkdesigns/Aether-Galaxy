# Stories of the Aether Galaxy  
*A narrative collection set within the open mythic space of the Aetherverse.*

---

## Overview
This directory gathers **narratives, chronicles, and recovered transmissions** that explore the lived experiences of the Aether Galaxy, its peoples, worlds, and mysteries.

Every story here is part of the shared **Aetherverse**, an open space-opera setting released under **CC BY 4.0**.  
Each entry is self-contained and apocryphal. None are “canon.”  
Together they form a chorus of possible histories guided by one rule:

> **No canon, only coherence.**

## Structure
Stories are organized by format and intent:

| Subdirectory / File | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `/Archives of the Lost/` | Anthology of stories in which characters passed before their time. |
| `/Chronicles/` | Longer narrative works and campaign-derived stories. |
| `/Fragments/` | Stand-alone vignettes, myths, and short experimental pieces. |

You can read each story directly in Markdown or through the GitHub web viewer.
