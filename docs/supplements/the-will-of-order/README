# The Will of Order

*“To shield the weak from consequence is to blaspheme against nature.”*  
— Voice-Prime Goras Tyndelion, *The Will of Order* (GSY 8285)

---

## Overview  
**The Will of Order** is an in-universe political and philosophical text from the **Aether Galaxy** setting.  
Written as an address by *Voice-Prime Goras Tyndelion* of the **Iron Dominion**, it outlines the Dominion’s foundational ideology — a creed that exalts strength, evolution, and order as sacred principles.  

Within the lore, the document has endured for centuries as both scripture and state doctrine.  
Outside the lore, it serves as a creative artifact for worldbuilding, writing, and game development projects set in the Aether Galaxy.
