# Astrogation Holocodex (r1)

*Galactic Standards for Registry & Navigation*  
*Aether Galaxy – Commonwealth Bureau of Astrogation*

---

## Overview

The **Astrogation Holocodex** defines the official navigation and registry standards of the **Galactic Commonwealth**.  
It unifies two complementary systems:

- **ARC — Astrogation Registry Code**  
  The administrative address of a world, using a five-field hierarchy:  
  `Region – Cluster – Sector – System – World`

- **GCC — Galactic Coordinate Code**  
  The spatial coordinate grid in kilolight-years, used for plotting distance and hyperspace travel time.

Together, these systems make an entire galaxy navigable through simple, consistent records.  
The Holocodex establishes how both are formatted, interpreted, and applied across all Commonwealth space.
