**Aether Galaxy remains one of my greatest joys**  
But the truth is simple: right now I’m not operating at a level that allows me to treat it with the care and energy it deserves.

The last few weeks have brought unpredictable scheduling, chronic sleep loss, and a level of exhaustion I haven’t experienced in years. Because of that, my writing pace has slowed. Not stopped, just slowed.

**Kols Files Chapter 4 is still in progress.**  
**A new Supplement is still in development.**  
Both are moving, only at a slower pace than usual.

None of this affects my long-term commitment to the Aetherverse. This project is alive, it matters deeply to me, and it will continue to grow. I simply need some time to recover enough mental fuel to do the setting justice again.

Thank you to everyone who’s journeying with me.  
The galaxy is quiet, but still lives.  
More is coming.
