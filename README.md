## ✧ The Aetherverse: Powers and Orders
Aether Sagas takes place ages ago, in a far-distant galaxy of many advanced species. Civilization is shaped by two Great Powers—and by the ancient Orders that stand beside them.

- **The Galactic Commonwealth** – a democratic republic of tens of thousands of inhabited worlds bound by cooperation, trade, and shared ideals. It seeks unity through representation rather than conquest.  
  - *Allied Order:* **The Concord** – mystic wardens of peace and galactic mediators who draw upon the Aether, a living energy that grants telekinesis, telepathy, and other gifts. They wield the radiant sunblade, an elegant weapon of focus and grace.  

- **The Iron Dominion** – a militaristic, authoritarian empire built upon discipline, industrial might, and the belief that peace can only follow strength. Its colossal Life Burner capital ships and grey-armored Assault Troopers are feared across the stars.  
  - *Aligned Order:* **The Dread** – an ancient sect that preaches strength through passion. To them, domination is life’s true purpose, and fear and anger are the purest forms of will.

Nine thousand years have passed since the Commonwealth’s founding. The balance of the galaxy stands upon the edge of a blade. Without heroes, there can be no hope.
