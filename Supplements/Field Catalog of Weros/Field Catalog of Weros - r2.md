## Weapons

### Blaster Pistol, Civilian
Price: Cr200  
Comment: "Works fine on humans. Might be a bit under-kill for a Ruqan in battleplate."

### Blaster Pistol, Magnum
Price: Cr400  
Comment: "Captain, now that's a weapon!"  

### Palm Blaster  
Price: Cr220  
Comment: "Perfect for the Snod table."

### Kinetic Pistol

---

### Blaster Rifle  
Price: Cr1,300  
Comment: "Hey, you want to clear pirate decks. That's expensive business."  

### Blaster Carbine
Price: Cr1,200  
Comment: "Technically export-restricted to Dominion units. Technically, you didn’t buy it here."  

### Kinetic Rifle
Price: Cr975  
Comment: "You might want a few of these. Sometimes it's hard to find blaster cell fabricators on the Rim."  

### Shotgun
Price: Cr1,050  
Comment: "Pretty useful if you're cornered by a Dread warrior . . .or a Concordant."

---

### Combat Knife

### Arcdagger
Price: Cr800  
Comment: "Hell of a backup. Just don’t clip it near your datatab."

---

### Stun Grenade
Price: Cr900

---
---

## Armor

### Cloak
Price: Cr5  
Comment: "Not much good against blasters. But hey, maybe they *think* you're wearing armor under it."

### Mesh Vest
Price: Cr150  
Comment: "Yeah, here's a good place to save money, the thing that stops you from getting killed."

Price: Cr3,600  
Comment: "Look, if the Inquisition asks, I don't have this, okay?"

---

Price: Cr1,200  
Comment: "Saved a dozen of mine once. Also made the rest of us feel useless for not having one."

### Space Suit
Price: Cr4,500  
Comment: "Good suit. Better to have one and not need it than need it and not have paperwork."

---
---

### Basic Medkit
Price: Cr50  
Comment: "Professional tip, Captain: don't get shot."

Price: Cr200  
Comment: "But just in case you do get shot, this is probably your best hope unless a Concordant is right there to help you."

---

Price: Cr60  
Comment: "With how long these last, I’m surprised I still sell any. And all for the price of a deckhand's day wage."

---

### Atomic Lamp
Price: Cr100  
Comment: "It's amazing what something as basic as atomic fusion can do."

### Lumen Rod
Price: Cr70  
Comment: "Standard model puts out enough light to blind a Harnak and still run twelve hours on a cracked cell. Try not to stare into it, Captain."

### Breather Mask
Price: Cr100  
Comment: "Filters the air, keeps the lungs happy, and makes you sound mysterious. Try not to scratch the seals with your stubble, Captain."

### Replacement Parts Package
Price: Cr120  
Comment: "Sometimes it's enough, sometimes not. But I hope none of your ships turn into this."

### Portable Scanner
Price: Cr240  
Comment: "If it’s alive, leaking, or about to explode, this’ll tell you first. Assuming you know which setting you’re on."

---
---

## Personal Transport

### Yatin
Price: Cr1,000  
Comment: "Sometimes you don't need fast. You need low maintenance. Just don't try to get around Coropolis on one."

---

### Motospeeder
Price: Cr3,500  
Comment: "Watch out for those motospeeder 'club' members at the cantinas."

### Groundspeeder
Price: Cr18,000  
Comment: "I've heard some horror stories about some of the traffic jams on poorer Middle Rim worlds without much air traffic."

Price: Cr28,000  
Comment: "Fast enough to make your money back in one race if you live to collect it."

---

### Atmospeeder
Price: Cr35,000  
Comment: "You can take her into the upper clouds, sure. Just don’t forget to come back down."

### Atmohauler
Price: Cr70,000  
Comment: "For shipping heavy cargo and mining on planet. The drive coils need regular tuning, but a well-kept hauler can serve a colony for decades."

---
---

## Starships  
Comment: "Sure, Captain. I can give you more information for these. They are a bigger investment after all. These are all new, by the way. I'm no used ship sales-Birin."

### Orbital Shuttle
Price: Cr130,000  
Hyperdrive Grade: n/a  
Comment: "Designed for short hops and station runs. Hyperdrive mount’s standard, but don’t expect it to come with one at this price. Still, not too bad for crawling around in the system."

---

### Light Courier
Price: Cr230,000  
Hyperdrive Grade: 2  
Comment: "She's basically the shuttle with a hyperdrive. Not quick, but give her long enough and she'll take you there just the same."

### Interceptor
Price: Cr400,000  
Hyperdrive Grade: 4  
Comment: "Built to chase smugglers, pirates, and sometimes its own shadow. Light frame, overclocked thrusters, and barely enough living space to stretch."

### Light Freighter
Price: Cr600,000  
Hyperdrive Grade: 4  
Comment: "Workhorse of half the galaxy. Big enough to haul something worth selling, small enough to still be personal. Keep her fed and she’ll forgive you, most of the time."  

### Light Frigate  
Price: Cr4000,000  
Hyperdrive Grade: 5  
Comment: "Frigate-class ships are where business turns into commitment. Crews, logs, and repair bills all multiply overnight. But she can stand in a fight, cross a sector, and make a name for whoever’s mad enough to command her. Also the biggest I can sell you, Captain. Still waiting on permits for capital ships."
