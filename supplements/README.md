# Supplements for the Aether Galaxy  
This directory contains all supplements which expand the setting itself with details beyond those in the Aether Galaxy Foundational Guidebook. 

None of the content in this directory is to be considered strictly core content. However it all exists to serve and expand the mythic space opera tone of Aether Galaxy. 

This content will, Aether willing, continue to expand over time, possibly including contributions from collaborators.
